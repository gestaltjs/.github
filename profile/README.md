# GestaltJS

Gestalt is a German word that roughly means "configuration," or the way things are put together to form a whole object. A core belief in Gestalt psychology is [holism](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-holism-4685432), or that **the whole is greater than the sum of its parts**. 

GestaltJS is inspired by that idea. It builds upon the [Chimera](https://github.com/gestaltjs/chimera) compiler to create an opinionated and batteries-included framework that, like [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), sparks joy when using it. It does so by providing convenient abstractions and workflows that [conceptually compress](https://m.signalvnoise.com/conceptual-compression-means-beginners-dont-need-to-know-sql-hallelujah/) the intricacies of building web apps and sites.
