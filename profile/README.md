# Gestalt

Gestalt is a German word that roughly means "configuration," or the way things are put together to form a whole object. A core belief in Gestalt psychology is [holism](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-holism-4685432), or that **the whole is greater than the sum of its parts**. 

Gestalt builds upon the concept to create **a Javascript framework that empowers software crafters to build and share their ideas with the world using web technologies**. It does it through an opinionated development experience, convenient abstractions, and the [conceptual compression](https://m.signalvnoise.com/conceptual-compression-means-beginners-dont-need-to-know-sql-hallelujah/) of complexities, making crafting software a fun experience.
